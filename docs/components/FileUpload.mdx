# File Upload

The `FileUpload` component allows you to upload the files on a website (or a webapp). You can upload the file ( like text documents, pdfs, pictures and videos etc ) by either selecting it or by dragging it into the component viewport.

You can use this component when you need to:-

- Upload one or more files.
- Upload files by dragging and dropping.

The `FileUpload` component is internally made up of 2 components, the `<SelectFile />` component and the `<DragAndDrop />` component. `<SelectFile />` only allows to upload a file by manually selecting the file by opening the desktop storage window. `<DragAndDrop />` allows us to upload a file both by opening the desktop storage window and by dragging the file and dropping it into the component viewport.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>multiple</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>
      when `true`, it allows you to upload multiple files. If it is `false`, the
      user can only upload a single file
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getFiles</td>
    <td>function `(allSelectedFiles: FileType[]) => void`</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>
      If you want to do something when a file ( or multiple files ) is uploaded,
      then you can do it by passing the getFiles function
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>showImageWall</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      If you want to hide the image wall ( i.e the component that shows the
      uploaded files ), then you can set this to `false`. Its default value is `true`

      Note:- This prop is only passed to the `<SelectFile />` component internally by `FileUpload`.
    </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>showDeleteIcon</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      If you want to hide the delete icon, then you can set this to `false`. Its default value is `true`

      Note:- This prop is only passed to the `<SelectFile />` component  internally by `FileUpload`.
    </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dragging</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      If you want to enable the drag-and-drop feature for file upload, then you can set this to `true`. Its default value is `false`
    </td>
  </tr>

> Note:- The type `FileType` is used so that all the returned files have a common structure. All returned files will have a `url` ( where they are stored in the system ), `name`, `id`, `size` ( in kb ) and `type` ( like pdf, image/jpeg, image/png, text etc ).

import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/components/BrowserWindow";
import { FileUploadExample } from "@site/src/components/FileUpload";
import { FileUploadDraggingExample } from "@site/src/components/FileUploadDragging";

<BrowserWindow>
  <FileUploadExample />
</BrowserWindow>

```js title="/src/components/FileUploadExample.ts" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { FileUpload } from "canary-design";

function FileUploadExample() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FileUpload
        multiple
        getFiles={(files: unknown) => {
          console.log("files from getFiles: ", files);
        }}
        showImageWall={true}
        showDeleteIcon={true}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export { FileUploadExample };
```

The above example shows the `FileUpload` component when `drag-and-drop` is disabled. To checkout the component with `drag-and-drop` enabled, checkout the example shown below.

<BrowserWindow>
  <FileUploadDraggingExample />
</BrowserWindow>

```js title="/src/components/FileUploadDraggingExample.ts" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { FileUpload } from "canary-design";

function FileUploadDraggingExample() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FileUpload
        multiple
        getFiles={(files: unknown) => {
          console.log("files from getFiles: ", files);
        }}
        showImageWall={true}
        showDeleteIcon={true}
        dragging // <-- dragging is enabled
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export { FileUploadDraggingExample };
```
