# File Upload

The `FileUpload` component allows you to upload the files on a website (or a webapp). You can upload the file ( like text documents, pdfs, pictures and videos etc ) by either selecting it or by dragging it into the component viewport.

You can use this component when you need to:-

- Upload one or more files.
- Show the process of uploading.
- Upload files by dragging and dropping.

The `FileUpload` component is internally made up of 2 components, the `<SelectFile />` component and the `<DragAndDrop />` component. The `<SelectFile />` only allows to upload the file by manually selecting a file by opening the desktop storage window. The `<DragAndDrop />` allows us to upload the file both by opening the desktop storage window and by dragging the file into the component viewport.

Note:- The type `FileType` is used so that all the returned files have a common type. All returned files will have a `url` ( where they are stored in the system ), `name`, `id`, `size` ( in kb ) and `type` ( like pdf, image/jpeg, image/png, text etc ).
